Recently, various studies from transport, health and biometeorological disciplines have touched upon the relevance of weather for daily activities and travel, yet a review and critical assessment of the existing knowledge are lacking. Hence, the aim of this review is first to bring together these contributions and provide a systematic and comprehensive overview concerning the impact of weather conditions on daily travel activities. Second, the methodological, contextual and behavioural backgrounds of the studies will be discussed. The major conclusion is that the existing studies present an incomplete and fragmented picture of the impact of weather on travel behaviour, which makes effective planning for climate change a harsh job. In the conclusions, some lines for future research will be recommended.</p>},

abstract = {<p>Abstract This paper presents a new formulation for the network design problem as it relates to retrofitting existing roadway infrastructure for bicycles. The goal of the problem is, for a minimum cost, to connect all origin–destination pairs with paths where each roadway segment and intersection meets or exceeds a lower bound on its bicycling level of service. The length of each optimal path is constrained to be no greater than a given upper bound, which is expressed as a function of shortest path length. Experimental analysis on the Austin, Texas downtown region shows that a systems approach will yield different results than an approach that separately considers connecting each pair of origins and destinations, and that placing an upper bound on the amount of deviation from the shortest path will impact the design decisions. Model parameters, although the defaults are based on existing research, should be calibrated based on local data. Variants on the formulation are provided that allow for a trade\-off between optimality and computational efficiency.</p>},

The panel survey, begun in Fall 1997, collects data on travel behavior and attitudes at six month intervals through telephone interviews. The panel sample is refreshed with new respondents at each wave to counteract the attrition between waves.

This article draws on the results of over 300 well\-designed empirical studies to provide guidance on how specific strategies can influence walking or cycling for travel: community design, infrastructure availability, infrastructure quality, programming, pricing, and combined strategies. Urban environments with high levels of walking and cycling for travel typically represent a combination of many factors that help promote these modes. The most compelling argument, particularly for cycling, is that only via an integrated range of built environmental features (including infrastructure and facility improvements), pricing policies, or education programmes will substantive changes result.

abstract = {Drawing on a panel of German survey data spanning 1999\–2013, this paper identifies the correlates of non-recreational bicycling, focusing specifically on the roles of bicycle paths and fuel prices. Our approach conceptualizes ridership as a two-stage decision process comprising the discrete choice of whether to use the bike (i.e. the intensive margin) and the continuous choice of how far to ride (i.e. the extensive margin). To the extent that these two choices are related and, moreover, potentially influenced by factors unobservable to the researcher, we explore alternative estimators using two-stage censored regression techniques to assess whether the results are subject to biases from sample selectivity. A key finding is that while higher fuel costs are associated with an increased probability of undertaking non-recreational bike trips, this effect is of a significantly higher magnitude among those residing in an urbanized region. We also find evidence for a positive association with the extent of bike paths, both in increasing the probability of non-recreational bike travel, as well as the distance traveled.},

This paper describes the development of methods to visualize and to analyze the lack of connectivity in a low-stress bicycling network. A proposed measure to evaluate bicycling networks is the fraction of origin–destination pairs, which are connected without the use of high stress, without excessive detour, and with the origin–destination pairs weighted by travel demand. A new method is proposed to classify segments and crossings into four levels of traffic stress (LTS) on the basis of Roger Geller’s classification of the cyclist population and Dutch design standards, which are known to attract the mainstream population. As a case study, every street in San Jose, California, was classified by LTS value. Maps that showed only lower stress links revealed a city divided into islands within which low-stress bicycling was possible, but these islands were separated from one another by barriers that could be crossed only with the use of high-stress links. The fraction was 4.7\% of home-to-work trips up to 6 mi long that were connected at a low LTS value. The figure would almost triple if a modest slate of improvements were implemented to connect low-stress streets and paths with each other. </p>},

abstract ={<p> Prioritization of networkwide bicycle investments is data limited in the United States. The framework proposed in this paper addresses the temporal factoring of sparse bicycle counts through Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling and introduces a novel spatial factoring method to expand estimates of bicycle usage to all network edges. Bicycle usage varies widely on the basis of weather, infrastructure, trip origin and destination, and cultural expectations, and this variability necessitates more-detailed volume models than those that suffice for automobile use. A multilevel temporal model that includes hourly, weather-related, and commute-day factors maximizes the information obtained from sparse count observations. Spatial factoring then extends these data to cover unobserved streets through Bayesian updating of prior estimates from a regional travel demand model informed by an edge correlation matrix. For a small city in the United States with some manual volunteer bicycle counts and no permanent counting infrastructure, the proposed framework was able to estimate an edge-specific bicycle usage networkwide reasonably and, unlike typical factoring methods, as distributions rather than single values. This rigorous characterization of parameter variance allows planners and software to interpret results appropriately and to avoid the common misconception that all model outputs are equally valid. The framework is globally applicable because it is based on open-source tools and data and will be used in the upcoming long-range plan for the study region. By providing comprehensive safety exposure data, the framework enables networkwide safety prioritization with empirical Bayes methods to allocate scarce funds.</p>},

However, there is little insight into the drivers behind this phenomenon, specifically which policy interventions increased cycling rates and which did not. The knowledge gap on the effectiveness of cycling policies seriously limits the potential for learning from the Dutch experience. This paper will address this gap, by exploring the performance of Dutch cycling policies in 22 medium-sized cities since 2000. First, the existing ideas regarding the effectiveness of cycling policy are reviewed. These insights structure the exploration of data from Statistics Netherlands and the Dutch Cyclists' Union, complemented with a survey of local policy-makers by means of an explorative data-mining methodology called rough set analysis. Our findings support the following hypotheses regarding the performance of cycling policy in Dutch cities: first of all, the way cycling policy is implemented seems important: setting measurable and verifiable goals, following through with most of the proposed policy interventions, allowing for experimental measures to be explored and showing strong leadership. Second, providing adequate cycling infrastructure and decreasing the attractiveness of car use (e.g. by increasing parking tariffs and increasing the area of paid on-street car parking) seem to be key drivers. Finally, we found that external circumstances, such as demographic trends, seem to influence cycling policy outcomes. Future research is needed to test these hypotheses.},

Although cycling is an option for many commuters, a considerable number of them choose to use other forms of transport. In order to underpin policies that promote commuting by bicycle, this paper investigates the determinants for commuting to work. As many bicycle commuters do not cycle every day, we also examine people’s daily choices, in terms of frequency. We conducted a survey of the current literature in order to identify the determinants for commuting by bicycle. We found many determinants, not all of which are addressed by conventional mode choice studies and models. This suggests that predicting and influencing bicycle use needs to be grounded in other kinds of knowledge than those currently available for motorized forms of transport.},

US municipalities are increasingly introducing bicycle lanes to promote bicycle use, increase roadway safety and improve public health. The aim of this study was to identify specific locations where bicycle lanes, if created, could most effectively reduce crash rates. Previous research has found that bike lanes reduce crash incidence, but a lack of comprehensive bicycle traffic flow data has limited researchers’ ability to assess relationships at high spatial resolution. We used Bayesian conditional autoregressive logit models to relate the odds that a bicycle injury crash occurred on a street segment in Philadelphia, PA (n = 37,673) between 2011 and 2014 to characteristics of the street and adjacent intersections. Statistical models included interaction terms to address the problem of unknown bicycle traffic flows, and found bicycle lanes were associated with reduced crash odds of 48\% in streets segments adjacent to 4-exit intersections, of 40\% in streets with one- or two-way stop intersections, and of 43\% in high traffic volume streets. Presence of bicycle lanes was not associated with change in crash odds at intersections with less or more than 4 exits, at 4-way stop and signalized intersections, on one-way streets and streets with trolley tracks, and on streets with low-moderate traffic volume. The effectiveness of bicycle lanes appears to depend most on the configuration of the adjacent intersections and on the volume of vehicular traffic. Our approach can be used to predict specific street segments on which the greatest absolute reduction in bicycle crash odds could occur by installing new bicycle lanes.},

abstract = {BackgroundIncreasing urban bicycling has established net benefits for human and environmental health. Questions remain about which policies are needed and in what order, to achieve an increase in cycling while avoiding negative consequences. Novel ways of considering cycling policy are needed, bringing together expertise across policy, community and research to develop a shared understanding of the dynamically complex cycling system. In this paper we use a collaborative learning process to develop a dynamic causal model of urban cycling to develop consensus about the nature and order of policies needed in different cycling contexts to optimise outcomes. MethodsWe used participatory system dynamics modelling to develop causal loop diagrams (CLDs) of cycling in three contrasting contexts: Auckland, London and Nijmegen. We combined qualitative interviews and workshops to develop the CLDs. We used the three CLDs to compare and contrast influences on cycling at different points on a “cycling trajectory” and drew out policy insights. ResultsThe three CLDs consisted of feedback loops dynamically influencing cycling, with significant overlap between the three diagrams. Common reinforcing patterns emerged: growing numbers of people cycling lifts political will to improve the environment; cycling safety in numbers drives further growth; and more cycling can lead to normalisation across the population. By contrast, limits to growth varied as cycling increases. In Auckland and London, real and perceived danger was considered the main limit, with added barriers to normalisation in London. Cycling congestion and “market saturation” were important in the Netherlands. ConclusionsA generalisable, dynamic causal theory for urban cycling enables a more ordered set of policy recommendations for different cities on a cycling trajectory. Participation meant the collective knowledge of cycling stakeholders was represented and triangulated with research evidence. Extending this research to further cities, especially in low-middle income countries, would enhance generalizability of the CLDs.  Increasing cycling in cities is good for health and addressing climate change.•We used participatory system dynamics modelling to understand urban cycling.

Improvements include high-quality off-road facilities and on-road bike lanes. Whereas construction of off-road lanes is not always possible because of urban land constraints and construction costs, on-road lanes can be a cost-effective alternative. An optimization framework for the design of a network of bike lanes in an urban road network was proposed. This framework identified links on which a bike lane could be introduced. Allocation of a lane to cyclists would increase the use of cycling, although it could disadvantage auto traffic. The presented approach balances the effects of a bike lane for all stakeholders. A bilevel optimization was proposed to encompass the benefits of cyclists and car users at the upper level and a model for traffic and bike demand assignment at the lower level. The objective function was defined by a weighted sum of a measure for private car users (total travel time) versus a measure for bike users (total travel distance on bike lanes). A genetic algorithm was developed to solve the bilevel formulation, which included introduction of a special crossover technique and a mutation technique. The proposed optimization will help transport authorities at the planning stage to quantify the outcomes of various strategies for active transport. },

Many studies have found bicycle-motor vehicle crashes to be more likely on bidirectional cycle paths than on unidirectional cycle paths because drivers do not expect cyclists riding at the right side of the road. In this paper we discuss the hypothesis that opening all unidirectional cycle paths for cycle traffic in both directions prevent this lack of expectancy and accordingly improves cycling safety. A new national standard requires careful consideration because a reversal is difficult once cyclists are used to their new freedom of route choice. We therefore explored the hypothesis using available data, research, and theories. The results show that of the length of cycle paths along distributor roads in the Netherlands, 72\% is bidirectional. If drivers would become used to cyclists riding at the left side of the road, this result raises the question of why bidirectional cycle paths in the Netherlands still have a poor safety record compared to unidirectional cycle paths. Moreover, our exploration suggested that bidirectional cycle paths have additional safety problems. It increases the complexity of unsignalized intersections because drivers have to scan more directions in a short period of time. Moreover, there are some indications that the likelihood of frontal crashes between cyclists increases. We reject the hypothesis that opening all unidirectional cycle paths for cycle traffic in both directions will improve cycle safety. We recommend more attention for mitigating measures given the widespread application of bidirectional cycle paths in the Netherlands.},

The bicycle is gaining ground as an inexpensive, fast, healthy, and enjoyable mode of transport, but the development of cycle infrastructures appears to be a necessary prerequisite for supporting further growth in cycling rates. Thus far, few studies have developed comprehensive methodologies for the prioritisation of cycling infrastructure investments, and the role of end users has been underestimated in this process. The unique relationship that cyclists develop with the bicycle itself, their co-cyclists, bicycle facilities, and the urban environment as a result of sensory, kinaesthetic, symbolic, or even political reasons can assist in designing cycle facilities that are more efficient and closer to fulfilling the needs and desires of users. We propose a comprehensive four-step methodology for cycle network planning, which both accounts for the city structure and the zones in which higher cycling demand is possible and uses participative multicriteria GIS processes to incorporate cyclists’ views with regard to choosing the cycle network segments. Our case study is Athens, Greece, where cycling facilities are few and heavily fragmented, although cycling demand has recently grown. This methodology may be useful for cities attempting to introduce and prioritise cycling infrastructures because it focuses on determining where cyclists would prefer to cycle to make such investments more successful in attracting users.},

Our goal is to introduce BikeMaps.org, a new website developed by the authors for crowd-source mapping of cycling collisions and near misses. BikeMaps.org is a global mapping system that allows citizens to map locations of cycling incidents and report on the nature of the event. Attributes collected are designed for spatial modelling research on predictors of safety and risk, and to aid surveillance and planning. Released in October 2014, within two months the website had more than 14,000 visitors and mapping in 14 countries. Collisions represent 38\% of reports (134/356) and near misses 62\% (222/356). In our pilot city, Victoria, Canada, citizens mapped data equivalent to about one year of official cycling collision reports within two months via BikeMaps.org. Using report completeness as an indicator, early reports indicate that data are of high quality with 50\% being fully attributed and another 10\% having only one missing attribute. We are advancing this technology, with the development of a mobile App, improved data visualization, real-time altering of hazard reports, and automated open-source tools for data sharing.

Land use and road facility data were collected for 134 traffic analysis zones (TAZs) in the City of Vancouver, Canada. In addition, graph theory was used to obtain bike network indicators for each TAZ, including measures of connectivity, continuity, linearity, slope, and length of the bike network. A full Bayesian approach, accounting for spatial random effects among the TAZs, was used to develop the models. The results suggested that more connected, dense, flat, continuous, recreational, and off-street bike networks yielded higher BKT. Models that accounted for spatial effects were found to have better fit than those that did not incorporate spatial effects, which implies the importance of considering spatial effects while modeling BKT at the aggregate level. The models provide insights about the factors that influence BKT and information about the spatial variability of the bike travel within a city, which can be useful for planning bike networks.},

abstract = {Perceived cycling risk and route acceptability to potential users are obstacles to policy support for cycling and a better understanding of these issues will assist planners and decision makers. Two models of perceived risk, based on non-linear least squares, and a model of acceptability, based on the logit model, have been estimated for whole journeys based on responses from a sample of 144 commuters to video clips of routes and junctions. The risk models quantify the effect of motor traffic volumes, demonstrate that roundabouts add more to perceived risk than traffic signal controlled junctions and show that right turn manoeuvres increase perceived risk. Facilities for bicycle traffic along motor trafficked routes and at junctions are shown to have little effect on perceived risk and this brings into question the value of such facilities in promoting bicycle use. These models would assist in specifying infrastructure improvements, the recommending of least risk advisory routes and assessing accessibility for bicycle traffic. The acceptability model confirms the effect of reduced perceived risk in traffic free conditions and the effects of signal controlled junctions and right turns. The acceptability models, which may be used at an area wide level, would assist in assessing the potential demand for cycling and in target setting.},

abstract = {Barriers to bicycling may vary widely depending on individual, attitudinal, and built environment characteristics; barriers may be modest for some (e.g. requiring secure bike parking) or significant for others (e.g. improving regional bicycle-accessibility). This research suggests that for a substantial population of travelers who are interested in bicycling but unwilling to cycle regularly, barriers to increasing commute cycling may be different than for individuals who already commute by bicycle at least occasionally. Treating these two populations as one homogenous group may be inappropriate and reduce the effectiveness of bicycle promotion strategies. This research disaggregates these two prospective commute-cyclist populations and tests how attitudes, socio-demographics, and the built environment impact their commute mode choice. Socio-demographic and attitudinal data are drawn from a survey of “Bike to Work Day” participants in Denver, Colorado while built environment measures – including street network connectivity, street network density, and trip distance – were calculated with GIS. Bicycle commuting decisions within the two groups of prospective cyclists are estimated using binary and ordered logistic regression. Distinct socio-demographic and built environment factors are significant for different groups of prospective cyclists. Significant attitudinal variables are similar across groups; for both populations, convenience and utility of the bicycle relative to other modes is significant, suggesting that these factors outweigh issues regarding safety for the sample population. Findings from this research demonstrate that there are important distinctions between the decision to start commuting by bicycle and the decision to increase the frequency of bicycling to work.},

abstract = {Abstract Promoting cycling aims at reducing congestion and pollution as well as encouraging healthy and sustainable lifestyles, but generally clashes with the perception of crash risk while riding a bicycle that is still the most significant disincentive to cycling. This study sheds light on the factors affecting the probability of cyclist-motorist collisions while accounting for heterogeneity and spatial correlation. The current study analyzed the factors contributing to increase crash risk while riding a bicycle by focusing on 5349 cyclist-motorist collisions within 269 traffic zones in the Copenhagen Region. The model controlled for traffic exposure for both bicycles and motorized transport modes, evaluated the effects of infrastructure and socio-economic characteristics of the zones, and accounted for heterogeneity and spatial correlation across the zones. A Poisson-lognormal model with second-order CAR priors confirmed the existence of the safety in numbers phenomenon, contradicted previous literature about bicycle facilities not being helpful in reducing crash risk, highlighted the need for Copenhagen-style bicycle paths especially in suburban areas, and emphasized how heterogeneity and spatial correlation play a significant role in explaining the probability of cyclist-motorist crash occurrence.},

The main reasons for this difference are Canada's higher urban densities and mixed-use development, shorter trip distances, lower incomes, higher costs of owning, driving and parking a car, safer cycling conditions, and more extensive cycling infrastructure and training programs. Most of these factors result from differences between Canada and the United States in their transport and land-use policies, and not from intrinsic differences in history, culture or resource availability. That is good news, since it suggests the possibility of significantly increasing cycling levels in the United States by adopting some of the Canadian policies that have so effectively promoted cycling and enhanced its safety.},

With Edinburgh, Scotland, as a case study, discrete choice models, based on random utility theory and using stated preference data, were developed to determine the propensity to cycle and provide an estimate of cycling demand. The data are from a survey of 997 households in West Edinburgh. Respondents in employment or education were split into population segments according to their propensity to cycle. The survey includes a cycling-based stated preference experiment for those traveling to work or study by car, by bus, or on foot. The study is novel in considering the population as a whole, instead of focusing on cyclists, with the modeling results split by population segments. Model estimation shows that cyclist facilities, primarily at the destination but also en route, largely determine the propensity to cycle to work or study. </p>},

A bicycle network typically contains the following bicycle facilities: sharrows, bicycle boulevards, bike lanes, buffered bike lanes, and pathways. Using Moscow, Idaho as a case study, over 29 miles of bicycle facilities were analyzed to determine their impact on the bicycle network. The case study's bicycle facilities are part of a proposed improvement plan, which breaks up the bicycle facilities into 37 projects. To determine the importance of each project, a new prioritization method used open-sourced python code and geographic information systems (GIS) software to route every residential parcel to a defined "basket" of important destinations. (Routes were considered only if they were within a specified stress threshold.) The method produced a rank of each project's importance to the bicycle network, which provides planners and engineers valuable insight when facing challenging transportation investment decisions.},

Pedestrian and cyclist count data were analysed using the biannual daylight-saving clock changes to compare daylight and after-dark conditions whilst keeping seasonal and time-of-day factors constant. Changes in frequencies during a 1-h case period before and after a clock change, when light conditions varied significantly between daylight and darkness, were compared against control periods when the light condition did not change. Odds ratios indicated the numbers of pedestrians and cyclists during the case period were significantly higher during daylight conditions than after-dark, resulting in a 62\% increase in pedestrians and a 38\% increase in cyclists. These results show the importance of light conditions on the numbers of pedestrian and cyclists, and highlight the potential of road lighting as a policy measure to encourage active travel after-dark. •Biannual clock changes used to compare active travellers in daylight and dark.•Daylight increased pedestrian numbers by 62\% and cyclist numbers by 38\%.•Effect of light remained after accounting for temperature and precipitation.•Effect of light on cyclists varied depending on cycling infrastructure used.•Highlights potential for outdoor lighting to influence active travel behaviour.},

abstract = {Cycling accident risks are calculated using an innovative case–control framework. On-road tram tracks, bridges and complex intersections carry the highest risk. Shopping centres, van and truck traffic and parked vehicles also increase risk. Contraflow cycling reduces the accident risk. Accident risks may be high in points where no cycling accident is yet reported. This paper aims at predicting cycling accident risk for an entire network and identifying how road infrastructure influences cycling safety in the Brussels-Capital Region (Belgium). A spatial Bayesian modelling approach is proposed using a binary dependent variable (accident, no accident at location i) constructed from a case–control strategy. Control sites are sampled along the ‘bikeable’ road network in function of the potential bicycle traffic transiting in each ward. Risk factors are limited to infrastructure, traffic and environmental characteristics.Results suggest that a high risk is statistically associated with the presence of on-road tram tracks, bridges without cycling facility, complex intersections, proximity to shopping centres or garages, and busy van and truck traffic. Cycle facilities built at intersections and parked vehicles located next to separated cycle facilities are also associated with an increased risk, whereas contraflow cycling is associated with a reduced risk. The cycling accident risk is far from being negligible in points where there is actually no reported cycling accident but where they are yet expected to occur. Hence, mapping predicted accident risks provides planners and policy makers with a useful tool for accurately locating places with a high potential risk even before accidents actually happen. This also provides comprehensible information for orienting cyclists to the safest routes in Brussels.},

abstract = {This paper draws on census data, mode choice, and regional household travel survey data to investigate the relationship between the varying levels of traffic stress (LTS) routes and bicycle travel behavior. Specifically, does bicycle level of traffic stress explain bicycle behavior enough to warrant its use given the limitations? Bicycle level of traffic stress is a new system of bicycle infrastructure classification for cities that cannot afford existing alternatives such as bicycle level of service which is more data-intensive. The LTS criteria lacks many of the input variables found significant in predicting both route choice and mode choice, including several that are required for its more expensive alternatives. The authors select the Salem-Keizer metropolitan area, a case study representative of the kinds of small and medium-sized communities that may prefer to use the LTS to evaluate cycling infrastructure given its lower input costs. The results validate LTS on travel behavior data from the Oregon Household Activity Survey (OHAS), but not mode choice data from the American Community Survey (ACS). These results suggest the LTS criteria may not be useful for cities looking to prioritize infrastructure improvements for specifically increasing commuter cycling. That said, results suggest the system provides a valid measure of a household's propensity to cycle. Further research on a broader cross-section of communities can clarify these mixed results. •A bicycle level of traffic stress road classification model is tested for significance in predicting cycling in a case study .The classification is tested using Oregon Household Activities Survey (OHAS) and American Community Survey.•The state-of-the-art zero-inflated negative binomial regression model is used to quantitatively define the relationship.},

abstract = { Per capita measures of cyclist collision safety may misrepresent the relative and absolute risks of cycling. Cyclist risk per distance travelled is a useful and accurate measure of commuter cycling risk at small geographic scales. Commuter cycling risk per distance travelled can be calculated using geographic information systems. Cycling is becoming an increasingly important transportation option for commuters. Cycling offers exercise opportunities and reduces the burden of motor vehicle travel on society. Mapping the risk of collision between cyclists and motor vehicles in urban areas is important to understanding safe cyclist route opportunities, making informed transportation planning decisions, and exploring patterns of injury epidemiology. To date, many geographic analyses and representations of cyclist risk have not taken the concept of exposure into account. Instead, risk is either expressed as a rate per capita, or as a count of events. Using data associated with the City of Hamilton, Canada, we illustrate a method for mapping commuter cyclist collision risk per distance travelled. This measure can be used to more realistically represent the underlying geography of cycling risk, and provide more geographically and empirically meaningful information to those interested in understanding how cycling safety varies over space.},
