\section{Basic Framework}

The goal of this research is to assess the quality of the London Cycle Network. How well does it serve its users? To do this, first I'll review traditional literature on the impact of infrastructure improvements on the rate of cycling, which will make it clear that only a comprehensive view of cycling infrastructure, analysis of the full network, can allow an accurate understanding. The limited work available that applies network analysis to cycling infrastructure will be reviewed. Before specifying research questions and methodologies, general network analysis literature relevant to this work will be reviewed. 


\section{Introduction}

More than half of the world's population lives in cities. Cycling is of obvious importance to the well being of the world's  urban population in terms of the macro-climate crisis, local pollution problems, and public health issues. A commonly researched question is ``what factors have the most significant effect on cycling rates?'' The review of literature that follows will argue that the majority of work on this question approaches the matter from a perspective of discrete policy intervention and the effect of marginal improvements on cycling. This fails to build a comprehensive theory of cycling rates that a network analysis approach can offer. Only network theory can offer a high level look at the level of service in a community. The review that follows takes the structure of an initial look at typical literature considering how to promote cycling, recent attempts to use network analysis to accomplish this same goal, and closes with a look at work in network analysis that can inform applying the field to cycle networks. The overarching theme of the review and the research that is proposed is the idea that no individual intervention is sufficient to change behavior until a comprehensive network of infrastructure that reflects the importance of locations according to centrality is created. The implication of this view is that infrastructure changes are unlikely to have a meaningful effect on behavior in the system until a critical mass or tipping point is reached in the network. 

Basic attitude is that improvements to infrastructure only matter to the extent that they improve safe connectivity to ``important'' nodes/edges.

\section{Literature Review}

\subsection{Relevant Literature regarding cycling generally}

The most important conclusions from literature that tries to predict cycling behavior is the focus on multiple types of cyclists, and the factors that influence each type's decision to cycle. Most often, four types of cyclists are used, ``strong and fearless'', ``enthused and confident'', ``interested but concerned'', and ``no way no how'' (\cite{dill2013four}). This categorization is sometimes changed to follow demographics, focusing on young, generally male, adults, older adults, and childern. CITE. The literature separates the decision to cycle into the decision of cycling frequency, how often someone who is willing to cycle generally chooses to do so, and the decision to cycle at all, with different factors influencing each decision (\cite{stinson2005comparison}). 

Despite behaviorial differences between these categories, research has shown that all cyclists are willing to sacrifice time and energy for increased safety on their route. CITE. Indeed, psychological research showed that fear is a significant factor during an urban cycling trip (\cite{ellett2018state}). This is important given the sensitivity cyclists show to efficiency. CITE. The impact of a route change can be very significant, for instance a higher frequency of stop signs on a route can double the energy required for a journey (\cite{fajans2001bicyclists}). Given the common trade off between efficiency and safety, it was found that the effect of infrastructure improvements is very dependent on context, effect is a function of the change in safety, and the importance of the location to trips (\cite{kondo2018bike}), improvements that meaningfully increase safety at important locations have the largest effect. 

Several studies looked at the importance of perception in behavior change, assuming that a real change in safety is irrelevant if it is not perceived by potential cyclists as a change(\cite{li2012physical} and \cite{parkin2007models}). This gives rise to literature that focuses on a behavior and attitude change approach from psychology the prioritizes change in habits and perception over infrastructure, with changes to the built environment only used where required to change perception (\cite{savan2017integrated}). This should be considered in the context of research showing that cyclist perceptions of danger are generally accurate (\cite{vandenbulcke2014predicting}). Thus it seems reasonable to conclude that despite the decision to cycle being a fairly complex mix of factors, the decision for almost any urban commuter, comes down to safety, and efficiency. An efficient network of safe edges, connecting important nodes, would be expected to have a meaningful effect on the rate of cycling in an urban area.

\subsection{Literature addressing cycling From a network perspective}


\cite{buehler2016bikeway} is a very useful introduction to the literature on cycling networks. Unfortunately it concludes that very little true network analysis has been developed for cycle networks. The majority of papers they found could be categorized into those that focus exclusively on nodes, and those that focus on edges of the dual graph, where intersections are nodes and streets are edges. At the time of writing there were 115 papers citing Buehler's review, however all but 5 of them fail to take Buehler's central recommendation that \textit{If individual characteristics of a network's links and nodes contribute to cycling levels, it logically follows that a network of such features would as well...}. The ``Toward Studying the Whole Bicycling Network'' section of Buehler's review is a good overview of attempts up to 2016. The key findings were that continuity and connectivity of infrastructure is valued by cyclists. Of particular interest is the \cite{schoner2014missing} study of the relationship between network characteristics and cycling mode share in 74 US cities. That study found density of the network had the highest elasticity for effect on cycling rate. 

Several of the works reviewed contribute new ways of measuring ``quality'' of the infrastructure, these quality measures include a Bicycle Compatibility Index (BCI) (\cite{klobucar2007network}),  Bicycle Level of Service (BLOS) (\cite{lowry2012assessment}), and Level of Traffic Stress (LTS) (\cite{mekuria2012low}). Each of these can reasonably be viewed as an attempt to measure the ``safety'' of a network link. These studies generally lacked a rigorous method for prioritizing nodes by importance or defining a sample set of trips between nodes. Improvements to this will be addressed in the section reviewing network analysis literature. 

Buehler notes that a key challenge to using the network methods reviewed is data availability, this research hopes that network analysis can be a method for reducing rather than extending the amount of data necessary to understand a cycle network, as network statistics could be used to replace some empirical measurements as discussed below.  They further criticize the approaches as lacking empirical validation. Gathering accurate cycle traffic data and safety data is an immense challenge as demonstrated by the flow estimation techniques of \cite{gosse2014estimating} and the safety estimate techniques of \cite{puchades2018role}, which focuses on near misses as a proxy for predicting actual safety incidents, but acknowledges the difficulty of collecting near miss data without human observation. CITE. 

Since the publication of Buehler's review, the papers extending the full network analysis method have had moderate success. \cite{akbarzadeh2018designing} uses taxi trip data to weight the links between destinations in order to build communities of nodes that tend to be origin and destination pairs. While this is a novel approach to prioritizing edges, taxi usage tends to be for less frequent travel between nodes and the general literature as well as this work focuses on daily commuting, which is rarely accomplished by taxi. \cite{boisjoly2019bicycle} focuses on the directness of routes on cycle paths between nodes. 

\cite{doorley2019designing} focus on building cycle infrastructure to maximize a function of travel costs, infrastructure costs, health, traffic accidents, and pollution. While this is an interesting approach, it addresses a more political question in the sense that the key result of the algorithm is to recommend a specific amount of investment in cycle infrastructure to maximize the costs and benefits to all road users, The author's fail to recognize the prioritizing the goals of public policy is a highly normative and subjective exercise and that a model designed to give an ``objective'' answer to this question inherently reflects the author's preferences and when calibrated to ``the real world'' reflects the biases and preferences of the status quo, rather than the true ideal outcomes preferred by a population. Instead, modeling, especially for urban planning purposes, should accept an exogenous goal and implement it as efficiently as possible. For instance, cycle infrastructure, is explicitly intended to reduce motor vehicle use, it would make no sense to then use a model that determines the efficient level of motor vehicle use, the political process has already determined the answer and merely asks for implementation recommendations from the modeler. 

\cite{mauttone2017bicycle} similarly focuses on an optimization framework for cycling networks, choosing a subset of streets that are ``suitable to building cycle infrastructure''. This is odd in the sense that the goal of building cycle infrastructure is to \textit{create} streets that are suitable for cycling, not merely identify them. Similar to \cite{doorley2019designing}, they identify a cost to building cycle paths which they seek to balance against the benefits. 

Overall, it is not clear that a model for building cycle paths should be particularly cost sensitive. \cite{gu2017cost} found a very high return on investment to the budget for cycling infrastructure in New York City. The very idea of using network analysis for the development of cycle networks emphasizes the potential non linearity of the effect of building more infrastructure, with usage accelerating as the network approaches ``completeness'' in some for. In addition, cities tend to combine cycle infrastructure improvement with other required improvement and maintenance activities, mitigating the costs by being opportunistic in implementation. 

Lastly, \cite{osama2017models} uses a number of predictors including network statistics to predict bike travel within zones of Vancouver similar to \cite{schoner2014missing}. They found a positive coefficient for the density of the bike network in the zone. 

Thus while network analysis has been applied to cycle infrastructure, clearly there is not a consensus on the methodology. In particular, a definition of ``quality'' or ``safety'' has not been established. Additionally, a method for exploring the network of infrastructure defined is still lacking. Lastly,

%	For instance \textit{One study linked cycling levels to self reported measures of the bicycling environment, including being able to take shortcuts on a bicycle compared to routes available to cars.

\subsection{Network analysis Literature relevant to the research methodology proposed}

\textit{note: this section should probably be worked into the review of cycle network analysis above instead of separated out. Combine criticisms of existing work and solutions from network science.}

This work intends to improve upon the work detailed above through the inclusion of more ideas from network science that can improve and extend and simplify the models already specified. 

There are a number of considerations from network analysis literature that can complement the work already applying the field to cycling networks. Perhaps the most important is the idea that the transportation network and the location of activities in a city reinforce each other. The most productive activities that occur in a city tend to be the most easily accessed according to central place theory. This has been shown empirically for instance by \cite{porta2012street} and by \cite{wang2011street}. In the literature discussed above authors address the key change in networks of defining a computationally feasible set of trips between nodes in a few different ways. This is misguided though as network theory offers a number of tools for exploring a graph efficiently. A random walk weighted by a centrality measure will tend toward trips between more important nodes because these tend to be more central. For instance \cite{Jiang2009characterizing} or  \cite{volchenkov2007random} both show that weighted random walks can do a accurate job of representing human activity on a street network. 

A number of network statistics are used in the literature reviewed above. \cite{crucitti2006centrality} complements these as the centrality and connectedness measures used should be more formally justified according to network theory. 

While, the multiplex offers an interesting approach to studying the interaction between bicycle usage and train and bus, this is beyond the scope of this work and perhaps beyond the scope of London , where bicycles are not generally allowed on public transport, unlike some other cities. 

The potential for a ``transition'' in the cycle network per \cite{barthelemy2018transitions} is an exciting possibility. Finding edges that need to be added to a network in order for a transition in network connectivity to occur is a valuable exercise. In addition, specifying network characteristics according to those specified by \cite{barthelemy2011spatial} is also very valuable. 

Overall there are a number of considerations from network science that this research intends to add to the analysis of cycle networks. The exact implementation of these considerations will be specified in the methodology section. 

%\textbf{
%The key questions that need to be addressed by this lit are: 
%\begin{itemize}
%\item How to rigorously compare distributions of centrality?
%\item Dual or Primal graph? 
%\item How to actually do what I intend to do, a manual of some sort?
%\item Anything to do with growing one network on top of another. 
%\item Address and dismiss multiplex  networks approach.
%\item The potential for a ``transition'' in the network?
%\item Which centrality indices to use?
%\item Justify centrality as a way of prioritizing connectivity as a shortcut.  i.e. use centrality to weight nodes. 
%\item Community identification in planar graphs? 
%\item Could a weighted random walk be a good proxy for trips? 
%\item Could it make sense using the dual graph, to add an edge to ach intersection node so that the node could be a destination but also include information about the level of stress associated with traveling through the node? 
%\end{itemize}
%}
%
%Crossover from scale free to spatial network:
%
%What is distinct about spatial networks: distance weighted, preferential attachment and distance selection. When distance effect is significant, connectivity dist has a cutoff depending on node density, clustering coeff is very high, assortivity, positive max to degree correlation
%\cite{barthelemy2003crossover}
%
%Spatial Networks:
%
%relevant part is the review of processes that take place on spatial networks. 
%Phase transitions, random walks, synchronization, navigation, resilience, disease spread. 
%\cite{barthelemy2011spatial}
%
%Probably the most interesting because using percolation, as edges are added to a spatial network, a ``giant component'' suddenly emerges that connects the majority of nodes. This could be the specific goal of the research, how close is the London cycle network to this type of transition? 
%\cite{barthelemy2018transitions}

\section{Intended research Questions and Methodology}

Overall Goal is to assess London's cycle network. 
	Sub goal 1 is to define the London cycle network, which streets and intersections should be added to the official cycle lanes? I can use the standards from the literature cited above. 
	Sub goal 2 is to define a standard to evaluate the network by. This could be, percolation, community detection, centrality distribution, or \% of trips possible.   

Possible Specific Research Questions
	Conservative: What does London look like to a cyclist? Build network according to different rules and compare
		traffic stress
			intersections
			streets
		no right turns
		only official bike network
			
			
	Moderate: community detection using the stuff from the conservative project, where is the network the strongest? Are there parts of London with particularly good local networks? 
	
	
	Aggressive: how closely has the London network followed an optimal growth of network on network? 
		This could use standard measures of street centrality for the road network and look at accessibility for the most important streets.  
		
		
		Or compare centrality distribution of bike networks to streets, use street centrality for given bike lane, are lanes relatively central or no? 
		
		Or compare evolution of rd networks to evolution of bike networks
		
Straightness is an interesting one but distance matters most I guess. 
Congestion is not really a problem for cyclists

Road network
	attach attributes to links and nodes
		bike lane with type
		traffic characteristics
		road characteristics
		traffic incidents
		
Remove links and nodes according to attributes

Compare distribution of centrality between estimated bike network and real road network. 

Use Cycle Hire data to validate centrality preference?
	But hires are station to station so would have to show that the probability of a station being a destination for a trip is influenced by stations centrality. 

Steps:

	get london road network
		just the data
		get the distribution of centrality measures
	get the london bike network
		just the data
		get the distribution of centrality measures
		
	give a road an index grade
		using accident stats and road characteristics
		
	add ``safe'' roads to cycle network
	
	compare disributions of centrality scores between road network and bike network. 
	
	compare network before and after Super Highway constructions
