\section{Introduction}

More than half of the world's population lives in cities. Cycling is of obvious importance to the well being of the world's  urban population in terms of the macro-climate crisis, local pollution problems, and public health issues. A commonly researched question is ``what factors have the most significant effect on cycling rates?''

This literature review will show that existing research is limited by two considerations. First is the scope of the analysis, considering individual changes instead of the status of the entire transportation network from the cyclists perspective.  Second is the difficulty of obtaining data used by the studies that do take a comprehensive network approach. 

After critically reviewing this existing research, a methodology for using open source tools and data to estimate the relative strength of a cycle network and a method for prioritizing improvements will be specified.

\section{Network Approach}

\section{Intended Methodology}







\section{Basic Framework}

The goal of this research is to assess the quality of the London Cycle Network. How well does it serve its users? To do this, first I'll review traditional literature on the impact of infrastructure improvements on the rate of cycling, which will make it clear that only a comprehensive view of cycling infrastructure, analysis of the full network, can allow an accurate understanding. The limited work available that applies network analysis to cycling infrastructure will be reviewed. Before specifying research questions and methodologies, general network analysis literature relevant to this work will be reviewed. 


\section{Introduction}

More than half of the world's population lives in cities. Cycling is of obvious importance to the well being of the world's  urban population in terms of the macro-climate crisis, local pollution problems, and public health issues. A commonly researched question is ``what factors have the most significant effect on cycling rates?'' The review of literature that follows will argue that the majority of work on this question approaches the matter from a perspective of discrete policy intervention and the effect of marginal improvements on cycling. This fails to build a comprehensive theory of cycling rates that a network analysis approach can offer. Only network theory can offer a high level look at the level of service in a community. The review that follows takes the structure of an initial look at typical literature considering how to promote cycling, recent attempts to use network analysis to accomplish this same goal, and closes with a look at work in network analysis that can inform applying the field to cycle networks. The overarching theme of the review and the research that is proposed is the idea that no individual intervention is sufficient to change behavior until a comprehensive network of infrastructure that reflects the importance of locations according to centrality is created. The implication of this view is that infrastructure changes are unlikely to have a meaningful effect on behavior in the system until a critical mass or tipping point is reached in the network. 

Basic attitude is that improvements to infrastructure only matter to the extent that they improve safe connectivity to ``important'' nodes/edges.

\section{Literature Review}

\subsection{Relevant Literature regarding cycling generally}

The most important conclusions from literature that tries to predict cycling behavior is the focus on multiple types of cyclists, and the factors that influence each type's decision to cycle. Most often, four types of cyclists are used, ``strong and fearless'', ``enthused and confident'', ``interested but concerned'', and ``no way no how'' (\cite{dill2013four}). This categorization is sometimes changed to follow demographics, focusing on young, generally male, adults, older adults, and childern. CITE. The literature separates the decision to cycle into the decision of cycling frequency, how often someone who is willing to cycle generally chooses to do so, and the decision to cycle at all, with different factors influencing each decision (\cite{stinson2005comparison}). 

Despite behaviorial differences between these categories, research has shown that all cyclists are willing to sacrifice time and energy for increased safety on their route. CITE. Indeed, psychological research showed that fear is a significant factor during an urban cycling trip (\cite{ellett2018state}). This is important given the sensitivity cyclists show to efficiency. CITE. The impact of a route change can be very significant, for instance a higher frequency of stop signs on a route can double the energy required for a journey (\cite{fajans2001bicyclists}). Given the common trade off between efficiency and safety, it was found that the effect of infrastructure improvements is very dependent on context, effect is a function of the change in safety, and the importance of the location to trips (\cite{kondo2018bike}), improvements that meaningfully increase safety at important locations have the largest effect. 

Several studies looked at the importance of perception in behavior change, assuming that a real change in safety is irrelevant if it is not perceived by potential cyclists as a change(\cite{li2012physical} and \cite{parkin2007models}). This gives rise to literature that focuses on a behavior and attitude change approach from psychology the prioritizes change in habits and perception over infrastructure, with changes to the built environment only used where required to change perception (\cite{savan2017integrated}). This should be considered in the context of research showing that cyclist perceptions of danger are generally accurate (\cite{vandenbulcke2014predicting}). Thus it seems reasonable to conclude that despite the decision to cycle being a fairly complex mix of factors, the decision for almost any urban commuter, comes down to safety, and efficiency. An efficient network of safe edges, connecting important nodes, would be expected to have a meaningful effect on the rate of cycling in an urban area.

\subsection{Literature addressing cycling From a network perspective}


\cite{buehler2016bikeway} is a very useful introduction to the literature on cycling networks. Unfortunately it concludes that very little true network analysis has been developed for cycle networks. The majority of papers they found could be categorized into those that focus exclusively on nodes, and those that focus on edges of the dual graph, where intersections are nodes and streets are edges. At the time of writing there were 115 papers citing Buehler's review, however all but 5 of them fail to take Buehler's central recommendation that \textit{If individual characteristics of a network's links and nodes contribute to cycling levels, it logically follows that a network of such features would as well...}. The ``Toward Studying the Whole Bicycling Network'' section of Buehler's review is a good overview of attempts up to 2016. The key findings were that continuity and connectivity of infrastructure is valued by cyclists. Of particular interest is the \cite{schoner2014missing} study of the relationship between network characteristics and cycling mode share in 74 US cities. That study found density of the network had the highest elasticity for effect on cycling rate. 

Several of the works reviewed contribute new ways of measuring ``quality'' of the infrastructure, these quality measures include a Bicycle Compatibility Index (BCI) (\cite{klobucar2007network}),  Bicycle Level of Service (BLOS) (\cite{lowry2012assessment}), and Level of Traffic Stress (LTS) (\cite{mekuria2012low}). Each of these can reasonably be viewed as an attempt to measure the ``safety'' of a network link. These studies generally lacked a rigorous method for prioritizing nodes by importance or defining a sample set of trips between nodes. Improvements to this will be addressed in the section reviewing network analysis literature. 

Buehler notes that a key challenge to using the network methods reviewed is data availability, this research hopes that network analysis can be a method for reducing rather than extending the amount of data necessary to understand a cycle network, as network statistics could be used to replace some empirical measurements as discussed below.  They further criticize the approaches as lacking empirical validation. Gathering accurate cycle traffic data and safety data is an immense challenge as demonstrated by the flow estimation techniques of \cite{gosse2014estimating} and the safety estimate techniques of \cite{puchades2018role}, which focuses on near misses as a proxy for predicting actual safety incidents, but acknowledges the difficulty of collecting near miss data without human observation. CITE. 

Since the publication of Buehler's review, the papers extending the full network analysis method have had moderate success. \cite{akbarzadeh2018designing} uses taxi trip data to weight the links between destinations in order to build communities of nodes that tend to be origin and destination pairs. While this is a novel approach to prioritizing edges, taxi usage tends to be for less frequent travel between nodes and the general literature as well as this work focuses on daily commuting, which is rarely accomplished by taxi. \cite{boisjoly2019bicycle} focuses on the directness of routes on cycle paths between nodes. 

\cite{doorley2019designing} focus on building cycle infrastructure to maximize a function of travel costs, infrastructure costs, health, traffic accidents, and pollution. While this is an interesting approach, it addresses a more political question in the sense that the key result of the algorithm is to recommend a specific amount of investment in cycle infrastructure to maximize the costs and benefits to all road users, The author's fail to recognize the prioritizing the goals of public policy is a highly normative and subjective exercise and that a model designed to give an ``objective'' answer to this question inherently reflects the author's preferences and when calibrated to ``the real world'' reflects the biases and preferences of the status quo, rather than the true ideal outcomes preferred by a population. Instead, modeling, especially for urban planning purposes, should accept an exogenous goal and implement it as efficiently as possible. For instance, cycle infrastructure, is explicitly intended to reduce motor vehicle use, it would make no sense to then use a model that determines the efficient level of motor vehicle use, the political process has already determined the answer and merely asks for implementation recommendations from the modeler. 

\cite{mauttone2017bicycle} similarly focuses on an optimization framework for cycling networks, choosing a subset of streets that are ``suitable to building cycle infrastructure''. This is odd in the sense that the goal of building cycle infrastructure is to \textit{create} streets that are suitable for cycling, not merely identify them. Similar to \cite{doorley2019designing}, they identify a cost to building cycle paths which they seek to balance against the benefits. 

Overall, it is not clear that a model for building cycle paths should be particularly cost sensitive. \cite{gu2017cost} found a very high return on investment to the budget for cycling infrastructure in New York City. The very idea of using network analysis for the development of cycle networks emphasizes the potential non linearity of the effect of building more infrastructure, with usage accelerating as the network approaches ``completeness'' in some for. In addition, cities tend to combine cycle infrastructure improvement with other required improvement and maintenance activities, mitigating the costs by being opportunistic in implementation. 

Lastly, \cite{osama2017models} uses a number of predictors including network statistics to predict bike travel within zones of Vancouver similar to \cite{schoner2014missing}. They found a positive coefficient for the density of the bike network in the zone. 

Thus while network analysis has been applied to cycle infrastructure, clearly there is not a consensus on the methodology. In particular, a definition of ``quality'' or ``safety'' has not been established. Additionally, a method for exploring the network of infrastructure defined is still lacking. Lastly,

\subsection{Network analysis Literature relevant to the research methodology proposed}

\textit{note: this section should probably be worked into the review of cycle network analysis above instead of separated out. Combine criticisms of existing work and solutions from network science.}

This work intends to improve upon the work detailed above through the inclusion of more ideas from network science that can improve and extend and simplify the models already specified. 

There are a number of considerations from network analysis literature that can complement the work already applying the field to cycling networks. Perhaps the most important is the idea that the transportation network and the location of activities in a city reinforce each other. The most productive activities that occur in a city tend to be the most easily accessed according to central place theory. This has been shown empirically for instance by \cite{porta2012street} and by \cite{wang2011street}. In the literature discussed above authors address the key change in networks of defining a computationally feasible set of trips between nodes in a few different ways. This is misguided though as network theory offers a number of tools for exploring a graph efficiently. A random walk weighted by a centrality measure will tend toward trips between more important nodes because these tend to be more central. For instance \cite{Jiang2009characterizing} or  \cite{volchenkov2007random} both show that weighted random walks can do a accurate job of representing human activity on a street network. 

A number of network statistics are used in the literature reviewed above. \cite{crucitti2006centrality} complements these as the centrality and connectedness measures used should be more formally justified according to network theory. 

While, the multiplex offers an interesting approach to studying the interaction between bicycle usage and train and bus, this is beyond the scope of this work and perhaps beyond the scope of London , where bicycles are not generally allowed on public transport, unlike some other cities. 

The potential for a ``transition'' in the cycle network per \cite{barthelemy2018transitions} is an exciting possibility. Finding edges that need to be added to a network in order for a transition in network connectivity to occur is a valuable exercise. In addition, specifying network characteristics according to those specified by \cite{barthelemy2011spatial} is also very valuable. 

Overall there are a number of considerations from network science that this research intends to add to the analysis of cycle networks. The exact implementation of these considerations will be specified in the methodology section. 

%\textbf{
%The key questions that need to be addressed by this lit are: 
%\begin{itemize}
%\item How to rigorously compare distributions of centrality?
%\item Dual or Primal graph? 
%\item How to actually do what I intend to do, a manual of some sort?
%\item Anything to do with growing one network on top of another.

%\item The potential for a ``transition'' in the network?
%\item Which centrality indices to use?
%\item Justify centrality as a way of prioritizing connectivity as a shortcut.  i.e. use centrality to weight nodes. 
%\item Community identification in planar graphs? 
%\item Could a weighted random walk be a good proxy for trips? 
%\item Could it make sense using the dual graph, to add an edge to ach intersection node so that the node could be a destination but also include information about the level of stress associated with traveling through the node? 
%\end{itemize}

\section{Most optimistic Project Plan/Methodology}

Goal is to quantify the quality of the London Cycling Network with the working assumption that a better network has a meaningful positive effect on the rate of cycling in a city. 

The first step in this investigation is to build a data set that represents the London cycling network as accurately as possible. This representation needs to reflect the fact that different cyclists are willing to use different streets as a function of the perceived safety of the street and the level of confidence of that cyclist. Thus the data set will be multiple representations of the city cycling network that each represent a level of confidence, only including streets with a certain level of safety. 

A key question then is, how to quantify ``safety''. In a perfect world, this would be done empirically. This would involve a combination of cycle traffic volume collection, cycle traffic behavior observation, and interviews with a representative set of cyclists and non-cyclists about their decision making. All of this data could be compared to the cycling environment in different locations to find cyclist sensitivity to different factors.  

The literature provides a number of methods, which will be explored to the fullest extent possible. Factors that will be considered include, the presence of dedicated bike infrastructure, traffic volumes, traffic speeds, road characteristics, historical traffic incidents, and intersection characteristics. 

Once the network has been quantified in this way, two basic methods will be applied to evaluate it. The first is to compare the distribution of edges by centrality for each of the networks. Are cars and high confidence cyclists at a significant advantage in terms of the edges available to them compared to lower confidence cyclists? Does does the centrality of edges allowed under the most conservative standards explain many Londoner's choice not to cycle at all? 

The second method is intended to extend the first. Looking at the distribution of centrality is unable to reveal the network's actual service for common trips between important nodes on the network, because a high number of very central but disconnected edges is not as useful as a high number of high centrality edges with high connectivity. To investigate this, a random walk between nodes, weighted by node importance will be used. This will build a sample of trips and statistics about the random walk can be used to compare the experience of representative users of different networks. 

Finally, the possibility of a ``transition'' in the networks defined will be explored. What changes to the network are required for a dramatic change in connectivity to occur? This is the most uncertain but potentially most valuable part of the research. Past research has analyzed the linear individual effect of cycling infrastructure, but has not considered the possibility of a rapid acceleration in cycling usage as the result of a network wide transition in connectivity. 

Finally, community identification could be applied to the networks to find whether particular neighborhoods in London are especially good for cyclists. 


\section{Data considerations}

I still need to spend a lot of time with OSM, networkx, and the London data store. 

OSM has street network data, bike network data and some road characteristics. 

Networkx should be able to turn this data into a usable file. 

The London data store has traffic incident data but I haven't found data with exact locations yet

There is traffic volume data but it's at a few thousand observation points, so a continuous data set needs to be estimated. 

I think OSM is my only source for street characteristics, not clear that it's accurate or up to date.


Official data for cycle infrastructure is from 2014: \href{https://data.gov.uk/dataset/47f0a282-3356-4530-8e7b-f67aaf4bec63/cycle-routes}{link}

This says it's updated and maybe integrated into OSM? \href{https://www.cyclestreets.net/blog/category/open-data/}{link}

Press release about data set \href{https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/mayoral/action-plan-to-get-more-londoners-cycling}{link}

But no actual data. Seems like OSM is the delivery mechanism, unclear how integrated the data is into OSM. 


\section{Going Forward}


\subsection{Questions}

Data status, it seems like the basic data required for the work exists but it isn't clear how to access it and how to match different data sets up with each other. 

Methodology status, clearly the methodologies I intend to use are possible, they're used in other papers, but I need to find manuals/text books that actually discuss how to implement the methods.

%	Moderate: community detection using the stuff from the conservative project, where is the network the strongest? Are there parts of London with particularly good local networks? 
%	
%	
%	Aggressive: how closely has the London network followed an optimal growth of network on network? 
%		This could use standard measures of street centrality for the road network and look at accessibility for the most important streets.  
%		
%		
%		Or compare centrality distribution of bike networks to streets, use street centrality for given bike lane, are lanes relatively central or no? 
%		
%		Or compare evolution of rd networks to evolution of bike networks
%		
%Straightness is an interesting one but distance matters most I guess. 
%Congestion is not really a problem for cyclists
%
%Road network
%	attach attributes to links and nodes
%		bike lane with type
%		traffic characteristics
%		road characteristics
%		traffic incidents
%		
%Remove links and nodes according to attributes
%
%Compare distribution of centrality between estimated bike network and real road network. 
%
%Use Cycle Hire data to validate centrality preference?
%	But hires are station to station so would have to show that the probability of a station being a destination for a trip is influenced by stations centrality. 
%
%Steps:
%
%	get london road network
%		just the data
%		get the distribution of centrality measures
%	get the london bike network
%		just the data
%		get the distribution of centrality measures
%		
%	give a road an index grade
%		using accident stats and road characteristics
%		
%	add ``safe'' roads to cycle network
%	
%	compare disributions of centrality scores between road network and bike network. 
%	
%	compare network before and after Super Highway constructions
