* Proposed Research Topic, 300 words, what you wish to study, why it's important or useful

* Overarching aims of dissertation, 300 words
I'm considering a few different overarching focuses. One is estimating the effect of the construction of one or
 some of the cycle highways or the conversion of tottenham court rd. 
Another is simply studying how fractured the london cycling network is for cyclists of certain confidence levels. 


* Methodology 300 words
I've found existing papers that use estimates of the stress cyclists experience on a given road to estimate
 what the network looks like to different cyclists. 
The more difficult part is estimating traffic stress for cyclists and the population distribution of cycling
 confidence.

* Data sources

cycle hire data, London data store: traffic data, cyclist KSI data. Open Street Maps: London street network

Talked to Sarah Wise briefly about using data CASA has from Just Eat. 

Would love to find a connection to deliveroo to see about using their data but haven't yet found anyone with a
 contact. 

* Action Plan for March, initial steps
